📝 About PyBot – A Rule-Based Chat Companion
PyBot is a lightweight text-based chatbot built using Python. It uses simple if-elif rules and pattern matching with regular expressions to interact with users in a friendly and intelligent way. The chatbot now includes several engaging features:
- 👋 Personal Greeting: It responds to greetings like "hello" or "hi" with a warm welcome.
- 😊 Mood Recognition: Detects phrases like "I'm sad" or "I'm happy" and responds empathetically.
- 🙋 Name Memory: When you say "My name is Hema," PyBot remembers it and can recall it later.
- 🎮 Mini Game: Includes a rock-paper-scissors game where the bot randomly picks a move and compares it to yours.
- 🕰️ Time & Date Awareness: PyBot can tell the current time and date using Python’s built-in datetime module.
- 😂 Jokes on Demand: Say “tell me a joke” and it delivers a quick one-liner to brighten the chat.
- ❓ Flexible Input: With regular expressions, PyBot recognizes variations in input—not just exact phrases.
