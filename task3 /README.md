 Stock Portfolio Tracker 
 Program Description:
 This console-based Python application helps users manage a virtual stock portfolio using predefined stock prices. It's designed for simplicity and clarity, allowing users to perform four main tasks through a menu-driven interface:

🧾 Add or Update Stocks
 Users can enter stock symbols and quantities. The program validates these inputs and updates the portfolio accordingly.

📊 View Portfolio
 Displays a neat, tabular summary of all current stocks held, including symbol, quantity, price per share, total value per stock, and total investment.

💾 Save Portfolio to File
 Supports saving your investment summary to either a .txt or .csv file, formatted for reports or spreadsheet analysis.

❌ Exit Safely
 Allows users to exit the program cleanly with a farewell message.
